  //   1. We cannot get cset larger than available free space. Otherwise we guarantee OOME
  //      during evacuation, and thus guarantee full GC. In practice, we also want to let
  //      application to allocate something. This is why we limit CSet to some fraction of
  //      available space. In non-overloaded heap, max_cset would contain all plausible candidates
  //      over garbage threshold.
  //
  //   2. We should not get cset too low so that free threshold would not be met right
  //      after the cycle. Otherwise we get back-to-back cycles for no reason if heap is
  //      too fragmented. In non-overloaded non-fragmented heap min_garbage would be around zero.
  //
  // Therefore, we start by sorting the regions by garbage. Then we unconditionally add the best candidates
  // before we meet min_garbage. Then we add all candidates that fit with a garbage threshold before
  // we hit max_cset. When max_cset is hit, we terminate the cset selection. Note that in this scheme,
  // ShenandoahGarbageThreshold is the soft threshold which would be ignored until min_garbage is hit.

  // In generational mode, the sort order within the data array is not strictly descending amounts of garbage.  In
  // particular, regions that have reached tenure age will be sorted into this array before younger regions that contain
  // more garbage.  This represents one of the reasons why we keep looking at regions even after we decide, for example,

  //  Rationale:
  //    The idea is that there is an average allocation rate and there are occasional abnormal bursts (or spikes) of
  //    allocations that exceed the average allocation rate.  What do these spikes look like?
  //
  //    1. At certain phase changes, we may discard large amounts of data and replace it with large numbers of newly
  //       allocated objects.  This "spike" looks more like a phase change.  We were in steady state at M bytes/sec
  //       allocation rate and now we're in a "reinitialization phase" that looks like N bytes/sec.  We need the "spike"
  //       accomodation to give us enough runway to recalibrate our "average allocation rate".
  //
  //   2. The typical workload changes.  "Suddenly", our typical workload of N TPS increases to N+delta TPS.  This means
  //       our average allocation rate needs to be adjusted.  Once again, we need the "spike" accomodation to give us
  //       enough runway to recalibrate our "average allocation rate".
  //
  //    3. Though there is an "average" allocation rate, a given workload's demand for allocation may be very bursty.  We
  //       allocate a bunch of LABs during the 5 ms that follow completion of a GC, then we perform no more allocations for
  //       the next 150 ms.  It seems we want the "spike" to represent the maximum divergence from average within the
  //       period of time between consecutive evaluation of the should_start_gc() service.  Here's the thinking:
  //
  //       a) Between now and the next time I ask whether should_start_gc(), we might experience a spike representing
  //          the anticipated burst of allocations.  If that would put us over budget, then we should start GC immediately.
  //       b) Between now and the anticipated depletion of allocation pool, there may be two or more bursts of allocations.
  //          If there are more than one of these bursts, we can "approximate" that these will be separated by spans of
  //          time with very little or no allocations so the "average" allocation rate should be a suitable approximation
  //          of how this will behave.
  //
  //    For cases 1 and 2, we need to "quickly" recalibrate the average allocation rate whenever we detect a change
  //    in operation mode.  We want some way to decide that the average rate has changed.  Make average allocation rate

    //  sets, we do not yet know the exact accounting of how many regions will be freed by this collection pass.
    //  What we do know is that there will be at least one evacuated young-gen region for each old-gen region that
    //  is loaned to the evacuation effort (because regions to be collected consume more memory than the compacted
    //  regions that will replace them).  In summary, if there are old-gen regions that are available to hold the
    //  results of young-gen evacuations, it is safe to loan them for this purpose.  At this point, we have not yet
    //  established a promoted_reserve.  We'll do that after we choose the collection set and analyze its impact
    //  on available memory.
    //
    // We do not know the evacuation_supplement until after we have computed the collection set.  It is not always
    // the case that young-regions inserted into the collection set will result in net decrease of in-use regions
    // because ShenandoahEvacWaste times multiplied by memory within the region may be larger than the region size.
    // The problem is especially relevant to regions that have been inserted into the collection set because they have
    // reached tenure age.  These regions tend to have much higher utilization (e.g. 95%).  These regions also offer
    // a unique opportunity because we know that every live object contained within the region is elgible to be
    // promoted.  Thus, the following implementation treats these regions specially:
    //
    //  1. Before beginning collection set selection, we tally the total amount of live memory held within regions
    //     that are known to have reached tenure age.  If this memory times ShenandoahEvacWaste is available within
    //     old-gen memory, establish an advance promotion reserve to hold all or some percentage of these objects.
    //     This advance promotion reserve is excluded from memory available for holding old-gen evacuations and cannot
    //     be "loaned" to young gen.
    //
    //  2. Tenure-aged regions are included in the collection set iff their evacuation size * ShenandoahEvacWaste fits
    //     within the advance promotion reserve.  It is counter productive to evacuate these regions if they cannot be
    //     evacuated directly into old-gen memory.  So if there is not sufficient memory to hold copies of their
    //     live data right now, we'll just let these regions remain in young for now, to be evacuated by a subsequent
    //     evacuation pass.
    //
    //  3. Next, we calculate a young-gen evacuation budget, which is the smaller of the two quantities mentioned
    //     above.  old_gen_memory_available_to_be_loaned is calculated as:
    //       old_gen->available - (advance-promotion-reserve + old-gen_evacuation_reserve)
    //
    //  4. When choosing the collection set, special care is taken to assure that the amount of loaned memory required to
    //     hold the results of evacuation is smaller than the total memory occupied by the regions added to the collection
    //     set.  We need to take these precautions because we do not know how much memory will be reclaimed by evacuation
    //     until after the collection set has been constructed.  The algorithm is as follows:
    //
    //     a. We feed into the algorithm (i) young available at the start of evacuation and (ii) the amount of memory
    //        loaned from old-gen that is available to hold the results of evacuation.
    //     b. As candidate regions are added into the young-gen collection set, we maintain accumulations of the amount
    //        of memory spanned by the collection set regions and the amount of memory that must be reserved to hold
    //        evacuation results (by multiplying live-data size by ShenandoahEvacWaste).  We process candidate regions
    //        in order of decreasing amounts of garbage.  We skip over (and do not include into the collection set) any
    //        regions that do not satisfy all of the following conditions:
    //
    //          i. The amount of live data within the region as scaled by ShenandoahEvacWaste must fit within the
    //             relevant evacuation reserve (live data of old-gen regions must fit within the old-evac-reserve, live
    //             data of young-gen tenure-aged regions must fit within the advance promotion reserve, live data within
    //             other young-gen regions must fit within the youn-gen evacuation reserve).
    //         ii. The accumulation of memory consumed by evacuation must not exceed the accumulation of memory reclaimed
    //             through evacuation by more than young-gen available.
    //        iii. Other conditions may be enforced as appropriate for specific heuristics.
    //
    //       Note that regions are considered for inclusion in the selection set in order of decreasing amounts of garbage.
    //       It is possible that a region with a larger amount of garbage will be rejected because it also has a larger
    //       amount of live data and some region that follows this region in candidate order is included in the collection
    //       set (because it has less live data and thus can fit within the evacuation limits even though it has less

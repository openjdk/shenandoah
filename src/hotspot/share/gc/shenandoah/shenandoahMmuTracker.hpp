/**
 * This class is responsible for tracking and adjusting the minimum mutator
 * utilization (MMU). MMU is defined as the percentage of CPU time available
 * to mutator threads over an arbitrary, fixed interval of time. This interval
 * defaults to 5 seconds and is configured by GCPauseIntervalMillis. The class
 * maintains a decaying average of the last 10 values. The MMU is measured
 * by summing all of the time given to the GC threads and comparing this to
 * the total CPU time for the process. There are OS APIs to support this on
 * all major platforms.
 *
 * The time spent by GC threads is attributed to the young or old generation.
 * The time given to the controller and regulator threads is attributed to the
 * global generation. At the end of every collection, the average MMU is inspected.
 * If it is below `GCTimeRatio`, this class will attempt to increase the capacity
 * of the generation that is consuming the most CPU time. The assumption being
 * that increasing memory will reduce the collection frequency and raise the
 * MMU.

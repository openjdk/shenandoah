  // marking phase. In some cases, this can cause a write to a perfectly
  // reachable oop to enqueue a pointer that later becomes garbage (because
  // it points at an object in the collection set, for example). There are
  // also cases where the referent of a weak reference ends up in the SATB
  // and is later collected. In these cases the oop in the SATB buffer becomes
  // invalid and the _next_ cycle will crash during its marking phase. To
  // avoid this problem, we "purge" the SATB buffers during the final update
  // references phase if (and only if) an old generation mark is in progress.
  // At this stage we can safely determine if any of the oops in the SATB
  // buffer belong to trashed regions (before they are recycled). As it
  // happens, flushing a SATB queue also filters out oops which have already
  // been marked - which is the case for anything that is being evacuated
  // from the collection set.
  //
  // Alternatively, we could inspect the state of the heap and the age of the
  // object at the barrier, but we reject this approach because it is likely
  // the performance impact would be too severe.

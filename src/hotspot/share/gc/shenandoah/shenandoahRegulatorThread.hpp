 * The purpose of this class (and thread) is to allow us to continue
 * to evaluate heuristics during a garbage collection. This is necessary
 * to allow young generation collections to interrupt and old generation
 * collection which is in-progress. This puts heuristic triggers on the
 * same footing as other gc requests (alloc failure, System.gc, etc.).
 * However, this regulator does not block after submitting a gc request.
 *
 * We could use a PeriodicTask for this, but this thread will sleep longer
 * when the allocation rate is lower and PeriodicTasks cannot adjust their
 * sleep time.
